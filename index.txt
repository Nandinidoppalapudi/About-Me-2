I'm a new member of fall batch 2019 working on my Masters of Applied Computer Science.

I completed my under graduation in 2018 from Computer Science and Engineering at my hometown Guntur, Later I learned DevOps and Linux Administration  courses  and  love to play Badminton, Cricket, Soccer.

I'm very much interested to plan my career in Cloud Platform.
